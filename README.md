# Path To Anywhere - The Idea
Path to Anywhere is a very very very early WIP "game" that will revolvs around being placed in an evolving world with evolving characters where you as the player are not necessarily a hero or the main attraction of the story.
The keypoint of Path to Anywhere is that most of the procedural generation is not happening upon starting the game, but at run-time during the game/simulation. You start in a very simple world that will gradually introduce new people, locations, events and their relationships to one another.

Imagine a game that plays like Stardew valley, but in a world like in Rimworld. That is the idea.

# About
This is a project where I will work on when I feel like it. I have no big ambitions but I will keep going as long as I'm having fun with it. I have some experience with Unity but haven't finished any big project yet. Who knows, maybe this will be my first. 
At this point it can't be called a game but rather an experiment of what's possible with procedural generation in a simple 2D tiled setting.

# Dev Diary
I am keeping track of my progress in a [Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14qaK2lTarApAHKeGx19LlU0nqlOs1jd8FLCRkvf2gWo/). I do this for myself because it helps me realizing that I'm actually making progress and I just like it as my little game dev diary.

# Screenshots
At this point there is very little to show since I'm just building very core systems. All visuals are just for testing purposes. But since someone asked for it, here we go..
